     * then adding total bytes taken by members already in the stack. By typecasting data to char*, we are treating the data
     * as an array of elements of size 1. This way the arithmetic to calculate target index using memberSize works out well.
     * Lastly we copy memberSize bytes of the data into the data array using memcpy.
